2. File metadata is extracted (size, type, name)
3. File is validated for size and type
4. File is uploaded to Supabase storage
5. Metadata record is created in the files table
6. UI is updated to reflect the new file
7. Success message is displayed to the user
8. Cache busting is applied to ensure fresh content

### File Organization
1. Files are associated with a student
2. Optional association with specific phase
3. Optional association with specific task
4. Files can be searched and filtered by these associations
5. Files are grouped by phase and task for easy browsing
6. File type icons provide visual cues
7. Preview generation where supported

### Student Context Generation
1. Fetch student profile, notes, files, and subtasks
2. Construct a prompt with comprehensive student data
3. Send to OpenAI via edge function for processing
4. Generate a concise, actionable summary
5. Update the student record with the generated context
6. Display the context in the student header
7. Provide full context viewing capability
8. Enable manual regeneration

### Transcript Processing
1. Save transcript as a note in the database
2. Extract content and send to process-transcript edge function
