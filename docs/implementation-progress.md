## Business Logic Implementation

### File Upload Process
1. User selects or drags a file into the upload area
2. File metadata is extracted (size, type, name)
3. File is validated for size and type
4. File is uploaded to Supabase storage
5. Metadata record is created in the files table
6. UI is updated to reflect the new file
7. Success message is displayed to the user

### File Organization
1. Files are associated with a student
2. Optionally, files can be associated with a specific phase
3. Optionally, files can be associated with a specific task
4. Files can be searched and filtered by these associations
5. Files are grouped by phase and task for easy browsing

### Student Context Generation
1. Fetch student profile, notes, files, and subtasks
2. Construct a prompt with comprehensive student data
3. Send to OpenAI via edge function for processing
4. Generate a concise, actionable summary
5. Update the student record with the generated context
6. Display the context in the student header with option to view full context

### Transcript Processing
1. Save transcript as a note in the database
2. Extract content and send to process-transcript edge function
3. Use AI to identify action items, owners, and deadlines
4. Present extracted items in review interface
5. Allow counsellor to edit, delete, or add items
